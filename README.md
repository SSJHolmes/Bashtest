This is just me playing around with git bash since I'm new to the whole thing. 

Hopefully this helps me get more comfortable with the whole command-line-interface type of computing.

It's not that the regular command line isn't useful, but windows command line doesn't have a lot of the options everyone seems to be using. So that's an issue this works around. 

Whee thanks for dropping by
